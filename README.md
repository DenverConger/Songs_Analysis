# Overview
I wanted to do some interesting Data Analysis ON THE DATA Analysis. Using shapley additive explanations we can understand what our ML model is basing its prediction on and it is facinating! (And Difficult)

# Development Environment

RStudio:
	R
VScode
Conda Env:
	Tensorflow
	sklearn
	shap
	pandas
	seaborn


# Useful Websites

* [Tensorflow Debugging](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Shapley Additive Library Documentation](https://shap-lrjball.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

# Future Work

* Update the Model to get a much higher Accuracy
* Make an interactive shapley chart at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook
* add better comments
